# ESG at Heathprocact

We are committed to integrating **ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance)** principles into our technology.  

## ESG Indicators We Develop

- **Environmental**: Deforestation, water scarcity, air pollution monitoring using geospatial datasets.  
- **Social**: Land-use impacts, community exposure to environmental risks.  
- **Governance**: Transparency in data collection and responsible AI practices.  

Our ESG solutions leverage **NASA, Google Earth, ArcGIS, Copernicus, and Aqueduct** datasets to provide robust monitoring systems.  

> Sustainability is not an afterthought—it’s at the core of everything we build.
